In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with objects that are not properly retained or released. This often leads to crashes or unexpected behavior. Consider the scenario where an object 'MyObject' is created and used within a method, but not explicitly retained.  If the method's scope ends, the object might be deallocated prematurely, even though other parts of the code still reference it.  This is particularly tricky when working with delegates, blocks, or timers, where the object's lifetime is not directly controlled by its creator.
